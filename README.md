# GTC-Land-Type-Classification

## Project Description

This project focuses on developing a machine learning system for **Land Type Classification using Sentinel-2 Satellite Images**. The goal is to build an accurate land classification model that can identify different land cover types using satellite imagery, supporting critical applications in agriculture monitoring, urban planning, water resource management, and environmental studies.

## Problem Statement

Accurate land type classification is essential for various applications such as crop monitoring, detecting urban expansion, and managing water and environmental resources. However, satellite imagery is high-dimensional and requires careful preprocessing and organization before being suitable for machine learning models.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation (Phase 1)

* Collected the **EuroSAT dataset** (based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery).
* Verified dataset structure (stored in TensorFlow Datasets format with TFRecords).
* Extracted dataset and organized images into a consistent folder structure.
* Checked dataset integrity, ensuring proper labeling of land cover classes.
* Prepared the dataset for preprocessing and modeling stages.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) + Feature Building (Phase 2 â€“ Ongoing)

* Preprocess images through resizing and normalizing spectral bands.
* Analyzed class distribution across EuroSAT dataset (e.g., Forest, River, Highway, Residential).
* Implemented advanced augmentation techniques to improve model generalization:

  * Random flips (horizontal/vertical)
  * Random brightness/contrast adjustments
  * Random rotations
* Visualized dataset samples before and after augmentation to validate preprocessing.

### 3. Model Training & Validation (Next Phase)

* Develop CNN or transfer learning models (ResNet, EfficientNet, etc.) for image classification.
* Train models on prepared satellite imagery data.
* Evaluate model performance using comprehensive metrics:

  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * F1-score per land class

### 4. Deployment via Web Interface (Future Phase)

* Create a lightweight frontend application.
* Enable users to upload satellite image tiles.
* Provide real-time land type classification predictions.
* Display results with confidence scores and visualizations.

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Preprocessed Dataset**: Organized, normalized, and augmented EuroSAT dataset ready for training.
2. **Trained Model**: A robust land classification model with comprehensive evaluation metrics.
3. **Technical Report**: Summary document describing model performance, methodology, and challenges encountered.
4. **Web Application**: User-friendly interface for testing land classification on satellite images.
5. **Documentation**: Complete codebase with proper documentation and usage instructions.
